Hi there, I am a high school student who is passionate about tennis, basketball, math, and reading. I love nothing more than cheering on the New York Giants on game day and solving complex math problems in my spare time. But let's be real, I also love a good laugh, so if you ever need a pick-me-up just send me an email.

### More Information  

Besides my love for the aforementioned things, I am deeply interested in the social issues that plague our society, specifically poverty and racial disparities. I believe that it's important for everyone to take a step back and think about how we can improve the lives of those less fortunate. My research question is about how can we reduce poverty and racial disparities in our communities. I believe that by using qualitative way of thinking, we can come up with innovative solutions that can make a real difference in the world. I am excited to dive deeper into this topic and make a positive impact in the world.
