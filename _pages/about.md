### About me

Hi there, I am a high school student who is passionate about tennis, basketball, and movies. I love nothing more than cheering on the New York Giants on game day and watching movies in my spare time.  

### More Information  

I am deeply interested in the social issues that plague our society, specific poverty and racial disparities. I believe that it's important for everyone to think about how we can improve the lives of those less fortunate. My research is about how we can reduce poverty and racial disparities in our communities. I believe that by using a qualitative way of thinking, we can come up with innovative solutions that can make a real difference in the world. I am excited to dive deeper into this topic and make a positive impact on the world.
