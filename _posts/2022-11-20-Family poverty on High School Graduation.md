Family Income Disparity in High School Graduation in North Carolina
================

## Introduction

High school graduation rates have been steadily increasing in recent
years, not only for economically disadvantaged students (EDS) and
non-economically disadvantaged students (non-EDS). But we have little
knowledge on the rates for the two groups in recent years and whether the gap in graduation rates is reducing over time.

## Data and Report

Here is my **[report](/_pages/P12HSG03.html)** by analyzing high school
graduation in North Carolina. I downloaded the data from [NC
PDI](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/cohort-graduation-rates#4-YearCohortGraduationRates-883).
The EXCEL file includes high school students and graduates enrolled from
SY2005-2006 to SY 2021-2022 in NC public schools.

## Findings

The poverty effect on high school graduation rates for students enrolled
in North Carolina public schools has been significant over time. Data
has shown that students from economically disadvantaged students (EDS)
tend to have lower graduation rates compared to their non economically
disadvantaged student (NEDS) peers. In addition, the gap has been slightly increasing since 2019.

## Discussion

This is likely due to a variety of factors, including lack of access to
resources such as quality education, nutrition, and healthcare, as well
as societal and cultural barriers.

Students from low-income families may also face additional stressors and
challenges outside of school that can impact their ability to focus on
their education. These economic disadvantages can have a cumulative
effect on academic achievement, leading to lower graduation rates among
students living in poverty.

It is important for schools and policymakers to address these issues and
work towards providing more resources and support for low-income
students to help improve their graduation rates.
