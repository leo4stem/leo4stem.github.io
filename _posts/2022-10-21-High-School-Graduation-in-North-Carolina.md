# Introduction

High school graduation is a great concern for students, parents, and
policymakers. High school graduation rates have been steadily increasing
in recent years. According to data from the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES), the national graduation rate for public
high schools was 84.6% in 2020, which is an all-time high. This
represents an increase from the graduation rate of 80% in 2010.

This increase in graduation rates is seen across different demographic
groups and states, with some states having graduation rates above 90%.
Graduation rates for minority students, such as Black, Hispanic and
American Indian/Alaska Native students, have also been increasing and
closing the gap with White students.

Itâ€™s important to note that while graduation rates have been increasing,
there are still disparities among different demographic groups and
states. Some states have lower graduation rates than the national
average, and some demographic groups, such as students with
disabilities, have lower graduation rates compared to the overall
average.

Overall, the increase in high school graduation rates over the past
decade is seen as a positive trend and a result of collective efforts by
schools, communities, policymakers and other stakeholders to improve
education outcomes for all students.

# Data and Report

Here is my [report](/_pages/P12HSG01.html) by
analyzing high school graduation in North Carolina. I downloaded the
data from [NC
PDI](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/cohort-graduation-rates#4-YearCohortGraduationRates-883).
The EXCEL file includes high school students and graduates enrolled from
SY2005-2006 to SY 2021-2022 in NC public schools.

# Findings

There are two findings I need tohighlight. First, the high school graduation rate has been increasing since 2006 in North Carolina. Second, the rates has been declining since 2020.

# Discussion

Some possible reasons on increasing graduation rates include:

Improved educational programs: Many states and school
districts have implemented policies and programs aimed at identifying high-risk students. The early
warning systems can screen the students who are struggling academically. Then, teachers and schools
apply interventions to help those students catch up.

Economic factors: A stronger economy can lead to more job opportunities
for graduates, which can motivate students to stay in school and
graduate.

Demographic changes: An increase in the number of students from
immigrant families, who often have a strong cultural emphasis on
education, may be contributing to an increase in graduation rates.

Finally, I wouldl talk about the decrease in graduation rate since 2020. The main reason come from impact of COVID pandemic. Since 2020 March and April, many states required school closure. Students had to stay home and took online classes. The pandemic negatively affected teaching and learning quality.
